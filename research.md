My ongoing research currently centers around three projects: cumulative markedness effects, phonology in non-native speech perception, and the phonology of Paraguayan Guarani. 

## cumulative markedness effects

My research on phonotactics centers on the effects that *multiple instances* of infrequent sound patterns have on languages and its speakers, and if and how such effects are learned from the distributional properties of sounds in their language(s). For example, the English *th* sound occurs in frequent words such as *think* and *teeth*, but in English there are rarely any words with two or more *th* sounds and English speakers likely find words like *''theeth''* to be weird potential words of English. Patterns such as this one, along with speakers' intuitions about them, are interesting because infrequent sounds can have a *stronger* or *weaker* effect when they occur with another instance of a particular sound structure compared to when they occur independently, posing interesting questions about the variation and learnability of these patterns. And, these patterns challenge mainstream models of linguistic knowledge in meaningful ways.

This work details the computational properties of two different maximum entropy model architectures, which I call ''one-shot'' and ''multiple competitions'' models of phonotactics. This work describes the findings for counting cumulativity -- multiple vilolations of the same phonotactic pattern.

* **Young infants' sensitivity to cumulative phonotactic violations**. *In prep*
This paper finds that 5-month-old and 8-month-old infants are able to tell apart words with zero, one, and two violations of phonotactic constraints. We tested infants using a visual preference experiment paradigm using noncewords with zero, one, and two violations of nasal place assimilation, a phonotactic pattern attested in many languages such as English, Spanish, and Japanese. 

## Paraguayan Guarani

My research on Paraguayan Guarani centers on the language's nasalization system. Paraguayan Guarani Tupian language spoken by 5 to 6 million people in Paraguay and neighboring areas of Argentina and Brazil. The nasalization system of Guarani is quite complex because the leftward and rightward spread of nasality are strikingly different, therefore making it particularly interesting from the perspective of phonological theory and typology.

## non-native speech perception

More recently, I study how listeners perceive, or rather, misperceive, sound patterns that are unattested in their language. In addition to speakers knowing which sound sequences occur and don't occur in their language, they also know how their language *repairs* some of these underlying sequences. For example, English speakers know that words should not begin with [pt] or [ps] in English, but they also know that words such as ***pt**erodactly* and ***ps**ychology* are pronounced by omitting the first sound as opposed to saying something like ***pet**erodactyl* or ***p**erodactyl*. We know that speakers misperceive sound sequences unattested in their native language, but it remains unclear if speakers' perception of these non-native patterns is also biased by how their language repairs them. 

* I'm currently running online speech perception experiments with monolingual speakers of Korean to see if their misperceptions of illegal word-medial consonant clusters are consistent with the native repair processes of these clusters in Korean. I'm also comparing the predictions of various Bayesian models of speech perception that vary in their ability to encode information about the repair processes of the language.

Welcome! I am a third-year graduate student in the [Department of Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/). I work on questions related to phonological theory and learnability using experimental and computational methods in the lab. I'm also interested in fieldwork, nasal harmony, morphophonology, and typology and variation.

## theory and experimental phonology

I'm interested in evaluating the representational commitments phonological theories make through experimental and computational research. More specifically, I'm interested in how speakers simultaneously learn a grammar and a lexicon, and the different predictions theories make about such process. I'm particularly interested in the learnability and representation of faithfulness constraints. I'm currently investigating the learning of cumulative constraint interactions through artificial grammar learning experiments with the goal of understanding how faithfulness is learned and how it can be modeled computationally. 

## fieldwork

I've done fieldwork on two native languages spoken in the Americas. Through UCLA's Field Methods graduate course, I conducted fieldwork on Cantel K'iche', spoken in Guatemala, focusing on the language's ergative extraction constraint, agreement patterns, and tense/modality. I then started remote fieldwork on Paraguayan Guarani in April of 2022, and conducted in-situ fieldwork in Coronel Oviedo, Paraguay during the summer of 2022. My fieldwork on Guarani focuses on the language's nasal harmony system. Nasal harmony in Guarani is interesting because of the presence of nasal-oral stops, the special status of suffixes, the exceptionality and micro-variation of progressive harmony, and the major grammatical differences between regressive and progressive nasalization. I've also collaborated on research on the intonational system of the language (see [publications](publications.md)).

Welcome! I am a third-year graduate student in the Department of Linguistics at UCLA. I work on questions related to phonological theory using experimental and computational methods in the lab. I'm also interested in fieldwork.

## cv

You can find my CV here. 

## theory and experimental phonology

Input-output vs. output-output faithfulness in Optimality Theory, UR learning and the structure of the lexicon, cumulative constraint interactions. 

## fieldwork

I've done fielwork on two native languages spoken in the Americas. Through UCLA's Field Methods graduate course, I conducted fieldwork on Cantel K'iche', spoken in Guatemala, on a description of the ergative-extraction constraints and agreement patterns. I later started remote fieldwork on Paraguayan Guarani in April of 2022, and conducted in-situ fieldwork in Coronel Oviedo, Paraguay during the summer of 2022. My fieldwork on Guarani focuses on nasal harmony. Nasal harmony in Guarani is interesting because of nasal-oral stops (prenasalized or postoralized), the behavior of suffixes, and the exceptionality of progressive nasalization.

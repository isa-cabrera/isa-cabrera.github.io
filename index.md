Input-output vs. output-output faithfulness in Optimality Theory, UR learning and the structure of the lexicon, cumulative constraint interactions. 

## fieldwork

I've done fielwork on two native languages spoken in the Americas. Through UCLA's Field Methods graduate course, I conducted fieldwork on Cantel K'iche', spoken in Guatemala, on a description of the ergative-extraction constraints and agreement patterns. I later started remote fieldwork on Paraguayan Guarani in April of 2022, and conducted in-situ fieldwork in Coronel Oviedo, Paraguay during the summer of 2022. My fielwork on Guarani focused mostly focuses on nasal harmony.

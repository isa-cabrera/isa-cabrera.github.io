Welcome! I am a fifth-year graduate student in the [Department of Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/). I work on questions related to phonological theory, phonological learning, and speech perception using experimental and computational methods in the lab. 

I'm currently working on my dissertation, co-advised by [Tim Hunter](https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/) and [Claire Moore-Cantwell](https://www.clairemoorecantwell.org/). Other members of my committee are [Bruce Hayes](https://brucehayes.org/), [Megha Sundara](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/megha-sundara/), and [Canaan Breiss](https://www.cbreiss.com/). My dissertation explores how accumulating phonotactic violations affect probability and acceptability in the predictions of maximum entropy grammars, in the lexicon of languages, and in artificial grammar learning experiments. 

I also investigate the role of abstract phonological knowledge in non-native speech perception. And, I work on the phonology of Paraguayan Guarani, specifically on its leftward and rightward nasalization systems and its interactions with morpohlogical structure and the lexicon.

Welcome! I am a third-year graduate student in the [Department of Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/). I work on questions related to phonological theory, phonological learning, and speech perception using experimental and computational methods in the lab. I'm also interested in fieldwork, nasal harmony, morphophonology, and typology and variation.

Welcome! I am a fifth-year graduate student in the [Department of Linguistics at UCLA](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/). I study how a speaker's knowledge of the sound patterns of their language is structured and represented in the mind, and also the ways in which speakers use that knowledge across different linguistic functions. I combine a range of computational, experimental, and elicitation-based approaches in my research with the common goal of characterizing the structure and psycholinguistic nature of phonological knowledge. 

I'm currently working on my dissertation, co-advised by [Tim Hunter](https://timhunter.humspace.ucla.edu/) and [Claire Moore-Cantwell](https://www.clairemoorecantwell.org/). Other members of my committee are [Bruce Hayes](https://brucehayes.org/), [Megha Sundara](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/person/megha-sundara/), and [Canaan Breiss](https://www.cbreiss.com/). My dissertation explores how accumulating phonotactic violations affect probability and acceptability in the predictions of maximum entropy grammars, in the lexicon of languages, and in artificial grammar learning experiments. 

I also investigate the role of abstract phonological knowledge in non-native speech perception. And, I work on the phonology of Paraguayan Guarani, specifically on its leftward and rightward nasalization systems and its interactions with morpohlogical structure and the lexicon. I'm a member of the UCLA Phonology Lab and the [UCLA Language Acquisition Lab](https://languagelab.humanities.ucla.edu/en/), where I collaborate with members and mentor undergraduates in linguistic research.
